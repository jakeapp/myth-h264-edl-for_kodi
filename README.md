# myth-h264-edl-for_kodi
user job scripts to transcode mpeg2 files to h264 and retain edl functionality in kodi.. neither removes content from the recording one works better for content with commflags.

They are working...

In the future would like to be able to re-encode 720p h264 files at a cbr with a max bitrate as well
